# Flight Deal Notifier using APIs
A real-time flight deal tracker that monitors low-price flights from a specified origin (e.g., Ahmedabad, India) to various international destinations. It uses flight APIs to search deals, stores destination data via Google Sheets, and sends alerts through SMS or email when deals fall below a target price.
